Things to add to the simulation:
- Asymptomatic cases                                                    (complete)
- Quarantines, isolations, hospitalizations, etc.                       (complete, critical quarantines)
- Assigning each agent to a certain demographic group                   (complete, age)
- Mask wearing (lower global infection)
- Close places of specific types
- Households and spread in the home
- Different probabilities of spread at different types of places (you will more likely get the virus at a bar than a supermarket)

Improvements to make:
- Make the simulation more efficient
- Improve the accuracy of the dates of recovery for agents that start out with the virus
- Base cbgs_leaving_probs off of the entire week instead of only one day
- Figure out a solution for people traveling in and out of the specific locality
