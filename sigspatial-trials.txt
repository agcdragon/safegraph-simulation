topics counts 1, 10, and 50; 100,000 agents in all except 0.2; single CBG infected in all except 0.3

0. special cases
0.1. fully default parameters
0.2. 1 million agents
0.3. initially infected agents come from any CBG

Parameters
1. infection probabilities upon contact at POIs <= this also covers the mask wearing and social distancing interventions by reducing the global infection rate
1.1. 1%
1.2. 3%
-- 5% (default)
2. number of interactions
2.1. 1
2.2. 3
-- 5 (default)
2.3 7 (added because the R0 in 2.1 was too low to sustain the virus / result in a curve)
3. number of initial infected agents in the base CBG (% of CBG population)
3.1. 5%
-- 25% (default)
3.2. 50%
4. propensity to leave (% of normal likelihood to leave the house)
4.1. 25%
4.2. 75%
-- 100% (default)
4.3 50% (added because the R0 in 4.1 was too low to sustain the virus / result in a curve)

Interventions
5. generic quarantines (other household members still leave)
5.1. 4 day
5.2. 6 day
5.3. 10 day
6. household quarantines (everyone in a household quarantines when a single household agent gets sick)
6.1. 4 day
6.2. 6 day
6.3. 10 day
7. closure of POIs
7.1. schools closed
7.2. restaurants closed
7.3. nonessentials closed
8. mandatory quarantines/alpha (% of population is forced to stay in the house for the duration of the simulation)
8.1. 25%
8.2. 50%
8.3. 75%
